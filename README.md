Final Tattoo Appointment

Program Description:

Program is a simple Appointment schedule that asks for user input for information and date also Tattoo information it being designed for a Tattoo shop.. The program compares the dates selected and appointment that are already scheduled. The strengths are being able to change or look up the appointment when needed to, I would say the weakness is the ability to schedule more than one appointment on the same day as I know that depending on the size of the piece there can be scheduled more than one appointment.
